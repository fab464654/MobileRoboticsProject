        # FUNDAMENTAL PARAMETER!!! (Michele/Fabio)
        # HOW TO FIND THE RIGHT VALUE? Given the threshold, self.th, check at which distance the robot
        #        stops, with respect to the wall, let's call it "d".

        #
        # IN SIMULATION KEEP THE VALUE 50(째), otherwise the robot will not be able anymore
        # to stay aligned to the wall during the 'follow wall' state!
        # 
        # This algorithm is really sensible to this parameter, but also to the angular
        # velocity in the `align left` state, in which the robot is rotating.
        # Indeed, if the velocity is too high, the orientation exceeds the target
        # position, with a sort of overshoot!
        front_angle_half = 50 

        side_angle = 85 # angle width of regions 'left' and 'right' in degrees
        # E.g. left region goes from [front_angle_half; front_angle_half+side_angle]

        # 'back': min(min(ranges[135:225]),10) # MY ADD: read below

        # PROBLEM STATEMENT AND SOLUTION (with above line): (Michele/Fabio)
        # Without the introduction of a 4th region pointing backward, i.e. 'back' there
        # could be some problems.
        # In particular, when the robot is in a corner,
        # there could be problems, since left region, comprises also the
        # back of the robot (60째 to 180째!), and so, it could seems that there is an
        # obstacle/wall on the left, even if there is no actually on the left but
        # only "in backwards"! This is the case when, after having found a corner, the 'align left'
        # state makes the robot rotating, but not stopping since in its back there is a
        # too close wall, the one that has been just followed. This implies that it
        # seems there is an obstacle on the left, and consequently is not possible to
        # move from 'align left' state to 'follow wall' state! And this, sooner
        # or later will generate some issue, or at least makes the robot move in the
        # wrong direction, not following the right wall.

        # dangerous drawbacks.
